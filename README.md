RichWatch is **TUI** (Textual User Interface) for **AWS Cloud Watch**.  
It formats and pretty prints **Cloud Watch**'s logs so they are much more readable.  
Because it works in terminal, you can have updates from your **Lambdas** and other **AWS** services next to your hand, automatically refreshed and represented in beautiful way by excelent **Python** library [**Rich**]("www.costam.com") and [**Textual**]("www.costam.com"),
# Setup and Usage


> ⚠️ The TUI version of RichWatch is base on **Textual** witch is in progress. If you see any bugs please let me know. Currently TUI is only working for *Linux* and *Macs* but on *Windows* you can run this in script version.
